It works ig, cryex helped me not be dumb
to make this shit work just smack yo dicsord token at the bottom of Discord.py and make sure you have the right stuff installed
it gonna do that 1 thing called making a pycache, just let it or dont. idc. currently this only works for PC games, it may be subject to change if I want to. if you want to convert it to other platforms yourself just go to https://www.gamerpower.com/api-read and pick the platform(s) you want to use
